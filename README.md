Technical Documentation: My Dream Job Website (Astronaut)
Objective
To create a professional and engaging website targeted at children, showcasing my dream job as an astronaut, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. The website features a space-themed design with interactive elements and animations to captivate young audiences.
Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the webpage (title, paragraph, button, image, and additional section).
CSS: Tailwind CSS for responsive and professional styling, with a custom CSS file for animations (stars and rocket).
JavaScript: For interactivity (button to change text, background color, image, and show/hide a section).
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive design.

Code Description

HTML:
<h1>: Displays the title "My Dream Job: Astronaut!" with a pulsing animation.
<img>: A rocket image with a vertical movement animation.
<p>: Describes the astronaut job in simple, child-friendly language.
<button>: Triggers the changeContent() function for interactivity.
<section>: A hidden section with a list of "Fun Facts About Space" that appears/disappears on button click.


CSS:
Uses Tailwind CSS for a responsive layout with vibrant colors (blue, yellow, white).
Custom animations:
